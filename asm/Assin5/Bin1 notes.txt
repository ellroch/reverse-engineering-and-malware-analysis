What it calls:
    myCopy

Parameters taken / return values and types:
    two command line parameters taken (argc/argv)


basic structure:
    nested if/else checks and then returns.

What it does:
    if(one command line argument was provided (argc==2)){
      if(the command line argument is less than 0x29 (41) characters){
        call myCopy(argv[1])
      }
      else{
        put "password too long, must be under 20 characters"
      }
      else{
      put "need password"
      }
    }

Potential vulnerability:
    the if/else checks if the password is <41, not <20...
    (the called function allocates 40 bytes of stack space locally.)
